# OpenTelemetry Collector Builder action

This action produces an OpenTelemetry Collector using the
manifest file configured.

NOTE: This action relies on having the file
available in the working directory. This means that if the
manifest file lives in a GitHub repository, the repository
will need to be checked out before this action is run.

## Inputs

## `manifest-file`

**Optional** The path of the manifest file. Refer to the OpenTelemetry Collector
Builder documentation regarding the format of the manifest. Defaults to `manifest.yaml`.

## `architecture`

**Optional** The target architecture of the output binary. The options for this configuration support are the same as [`GOARCH`](https://pkg.go.dev/internal/goarch). Defaults to `amd64`.

## `os`

**Optional** The target operating system of the output binary. The options for this configuration support are the same as [`GOOS`](https://pkg.go.dev/internal/goos). Defaults to `linux`.

## Outputs

## `collector-file`

The binary generated by the running the builder.
